# Elevator Simulation
This repository contains a Python simulation of an elevator system using the SCAN algorithm. The simulation aims to model and analyze the efficiency of an elevator in a multi-story building. This simulation is done as our group's submission for the final project of our Modeling and Simulation Techniques course.

## Contents
- personclass.py: Defines the Person class, representing individuals using the elevator.
- simulasi_lift.py: Implements the elevator simulation using the SCAN algorithm.
- main.py: Calls the simulation function and prints the results.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/izzatarroyyan12/lift-modeling-and-simulation
2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
   ```shell
   cd elevator-simulation
4. Run the simulation:
   ```shell
   python main.py
6. View the simulation results, including the longest wait time, fastest wait time, average wait time, and other relevant statistics.
